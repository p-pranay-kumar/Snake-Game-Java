# Snake-Game-Java
This project is a classic implementation of the Snake Game using Java and Swing for the GUI. The objective of the game is to control a snake to eat food that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows in size and the score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
